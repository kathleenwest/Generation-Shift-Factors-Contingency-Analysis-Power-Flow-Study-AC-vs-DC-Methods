# Generation-Shift-Factors-Contingency-Analysis-Power-Flow-Study-AC-vs-DC-Methods
The project required the computation of the generation shift factors (GSF) based on a defined generator bus outage using the fast-decoupled XB version.  The GSF values were used to approximate the post-contingency branch flows based on a pre-contingency branch flow and the generator output before the contingency. The AC power flows were compared with the DC method for the MW and MVA flows.  Source code is provided in the same WinZip file for the functions calculating the generation shift factors and the approximated post-contingency branch flows.
